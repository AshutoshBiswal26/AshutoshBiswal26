Hi, my name is Ashutosh Biswal and I am a data scientist with a strong background in statistics. I have completed several online courses to enhance my skills, including the Data Science & AI professional certificate at 360DigiTMG, AI & Deep Learning program at 360DigiTMG, Data Sience in Marketing at pathsetter and Data Visulaization using Power BI at 360DigiTMG. By leveraging my diverse skill set and passion for data, I aim to excel in this dynamic field and make a meaningful impact in the organization growth I serve. 

Data Science Project: [Project Title]



Overview

A brief description of the project, its goals, and its significance. Provide context for why this project is valuable.

Example:
"This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict housing prices using various features such as square footage, location, and year built. It serves as an end-to-end demonstration of data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation."
